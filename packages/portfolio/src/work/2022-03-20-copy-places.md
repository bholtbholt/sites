I made the mistake of saving hundreds of my favourite places from around the world on my Google Maps _work_ account. Then I changed jobs. Google Maps doesn't support importing or transferring data between accounts so I hacked together this crude project to simulate re-saving data to the currently logged in account from the data export.
