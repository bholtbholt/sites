title: Magic-Eight Ball Workshop
---

I taught students <a href="https://elm-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Elm</a> through a hands-on workshop at Code and Conf, a conference presented by <a href="https://twitter.com/codecoffeeyvr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Code and Coffee Meetup</a> in Vancouver. After I provided an introduction and Q&A, we worked through exercises where everyone created Magic-Eight Balls.
