title: K.O. II Sampler Settings
---

I love my <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/ep-133" target="_blank">Teenage Engineering EP-133 Sampler</a> and noticed several of the stock sounds had hidden settings that were not accessible on the device itself. I did some reverse engineering and found a JSON blob in the header of the WAV files that stored default settings for each sample.

Because of the space limitations on the KO II (64 MB!), <a href="https://yuugo.art" target="_blank">David</a> created the Re:Pitch tool to speed up samples, an old technique for saving precious bytes. I added the KO II settings to it and learned about working with binary files in the process.
