	<p>
		After being away for several years, my partner and I moved back to Vancouver, Canada to
		reconnect with friends, family, and our communities.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm regularly releasing music under
		<a href="https://www.commacomma.ca" target="_blank">Comma Comma</a> and
		<a href="https://www.badbadpower.com" target="_blank">Bad Bad Power</a>. You can find me making
		beats at
		<a href="https://lossapostacos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
			Los Sapos Tacos Tuesday Jam</a
		>, monthly at
		<a href="https://www.instagram.com/loopsessionsvancouver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
			Vancouver Loop Sessions</a
		>, or periodically on
		<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@commacomma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TikTok</a>. I'm
		also learning classical piano at
		<a href="https://vsoschoolofmusic.ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">VSO School</a>.

	<p>
		I work at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a> on the UI Platform
		team. Our small team manages the infrastructure for our 25+ React microapps. We also build internal
		tools to make product development easier for frontend engineers.
